# Captain Lab Log

## Session: 2026-01-25 (4 hours)

### Summary

Monitored 3 bots for 4 hours with 30-minute check intervals. Respawned all bots 8 times.

### Progress Made

| Bot | Start | End | Delta |
|-----|-------|-----|-------|
| Adam_2 | 328 | 344 | +16 |
| Adam_4 | 268 | 276 | +8 |
| adam_5 | 274 | 281 | +7 |

**Total: +31 levels across all bots**

### Milestones
- adam_5 hit Strength 70 (first to reach target)
- Adam_4 balanced all combat stats at 60
- Adam_2 collected 23 hides ready to bank

### What Worked
- Combat training at cow field
- Style rotation for balanced leveling
- Short runs (2-5 min) complete successfully
- Character state persists between crashes
- Respawn loop kept bots productive

### What Didn't Work
- Long walks disconnect (can't reach bank/shops)
- Browser crashes every 2-5 minutes
- T1 protocol errors blocked connections by end of session
- Running 3 bots simultaneously causes resource contention
- Goal loop stuck at combat phase - never reached gold/gear phases

### Efficiency
~35-45% uptime. Most time lost to crashes and reconnection attempts.

### Root Causes Identified
1. Server running 20+ hours (needs restart)
2. Multiple Chrome browsers fighting for resources
3. WebSocket stability degrades over time

### Recommendations for Next Session
1. Restart game server before starting
2. Run bots one at a time, not parallel
3. Try shorter banking routes (Lumbridge bank vs Varrock)

## Session: 2026-01-26 (Continued)

### 05:35 Check-in

| Bot | Status | Score | Key Progress |
|-----|--------|-------|--------------|
| Adam_2 | Running | 346 | ~62 hides collected, near Draynor Bank, still Bronze gear |
| Adam_4 | Running | **301** | **HIT SCORE 300!** Varrock West Bank working, 10+ bank trips |
| adam_5 | Respawned | 311 | Atk 72, Str 77, Def 71 - stuck with full inventory, respawned with gate fix |

### Wins
- **Adam_4 hit Score 300!** Varrock West Bank path confirmed working
- Adam_4 successfully banking 10-20 hides per trip
- Combat stats all above 65 on all bots

### Active Issues
- Adam_2 still working toward 100-hide goal for Al Kharid tanning plan
- All bots still using Bronze gear despite 60+ Attack (gear upgrades blocked by selling issues)

### 05:40 - Brad_1 Banking Success!
- **Banked 18 cowhides** at Varrock West Bank
- Gate fix confirmed working: `ctx.bot.openDoor(/gate/i)` before walking
- Attack 72→73, Total Level 311→312
- Respawned to continue loop

### 06:00 - Final Gear-Up Mission (END OF SESSION)

Attempted to sell hides and buy gear for all 3 bots. Results:

| Bot | Screenshot | Combat Lvl | Total Lvl | Gear Upgraded? |
|-----|------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Adam_2 | ✅ | ~74 | 348 | ❌ Bank empty |
| Adam_4 | ✅ | 76 | 282 | ❌ Pathfinding stuck |
| adam_5 | ✅ | ~79 | 312 | ❌ GS paid 0gp |

**Victory screenshots saved** to each bot's folder.

### Session Conclusion

**What Works:**
- Combat training at cow field (excellent)
- Gate opening with `ctx.bot.openDoor(/gate/i)`
- Banking at Varrock West Bank (when pathfinding cooperates)
- State persistence between runs

**Main Blocker: PATHFINDING**
- Bots get stuck at waypoints
- Can't reliably walk long distances (cow field → bank → shops)
- See `captain/PATHFINDING_ISSUES.md` for detailed problem spec

**Tomorrow's Priority:**
Build robust pathfinding solution - this unlocks the full goal loop:
`Combat → Bank hides → Sell → Buy gear → Repeat`

## Final Bot States (2026-01-26 ~06:00)

| Bot | Score | Combat Stats | Equipment |
|-----|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Adam_2 | 348 | Atk 68, Str 67, Def 68, HP 67 | Bronze |
| Adam_4 | 301 | Atk 67, Str 66, Def 66, HP 66 | Bronze |
| adam_5 | 312 | Atk 73, Str 77, Def 71, HP 74 | Bronze |

All bots stopped. Good night! 🌙
